# Weather Service

## Frontend (Vite/React)

- Navigate to frontend folder
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to run a local dev server
- For tests `npm run test` and `npm run coverage`

## Backend (Express)

- Navigate to backend folder
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to run a local dev server

Once both services are running you should be able to access the frontend at `localhost:5173`

If needed the backend can be accessed at its only endpoint directly at `localhost:3001/api/weather?city={city}&country={country}`
